I grew up in Brazil
We brought the dog up from a pup. (to raise someone or something)
My brother always told me off for borrowing his records. (talk angrily because they're wrong)
Don't take after you older brother - he's a bad influence. (look or behave like another memeber of your family)
My sister look after me when I was ill.
I still look up to my older brother, and ask him for advice.
I'm hoping to (обнаружить)+find out+ the secret of his success.
