We've all got one - the friend with the +impossibly glamorous+ name +that leaves+ the Peters, Katherines and Margarets +among us feeling+ somewhat, well, +frumpy+. Sometimes life (or in this  case parents) +isn't fair+. But +it's not as if+ the first name you +get lumped with+ at birth actually +has an impact on your success+ in later life. Is it?

Albert  Mehrabian, +professor emeritus of psychology at+ the University of California, certainly thinks so. 'Names generate +impressions+, just +like+ a +person's appearance+ can generate a +positive+ or +negative+ impression: he says. 'But names +also+ have an impact when +you're not+ physically present, +such as+ when you send in a  CV.'

Mehrabian has +researched people's instinctive reactions+ to +hundreds of+ first names. It's striking how +many positive associations+ some names +carry+, and how negative +the connotations+  of others +turn out to be+ - +particularly+ when it comes to linking names  with 'success', which Mehrabian takes to include ambition, intelligence, confidence and +other such valuable workplace attributes+.

So what kind of name does it +take to reach the top of the tree career-wise+? Based +on+ research in the US, Mehrabian +says that+ Alexander +scores+ 100 percent +for+ 'success'. WiIIiam +gets+ 99 percent and John 98 +percent+. For the girls, Jacqueline +rates very highly+,  as do Diana, Danielle and Catherine. +Although+ Katherine, Mehrabian +points out+, does +slightly+ better +than+ Catherine.

But can the impact of a first name +really be that cut and dried+? Pamela Satran, +co-author+ of eight baby-naming books, is +less convinced+ that the power of a name can +be quantified+.

'There isn't +that much hard evidence+ that's +absolutely conclusive+: says Satran. She  +recalls+ one American +study+ where researchers +submitted identical+ CVs +to+ a number  of  +employers+. The forename +on half+ of the CVs was Lashanda, '+seen as+ a +stereotypical+ African-American name: says Satran. The name on +the other half+ was Lauren - +seen as much more+  white and middle  class. In +one study+, Lauren got +five times+ more +call-backs+ than Lashanda, says  Satran, but in +another study+ the +rate+ was +similar for+  both names. 'I've seen +similarly conflicting+ studies: Satran adds.

Angela Baron, +an adviser at+ the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, +takes an understandably dim view of+ employers who make +decisions+ on +the basis of+ first names. 'People do make +emotive judgements+: she says, but 'we shouldn't be +recruiting+ people +on that basis+. Good +interviewers+ will +be aware+ that what they need to +look for+ are +skills+, +experience+ and +what+ [the interviewee] can do for the business.'

Celebrities are +leading the field+ in +the bizarre forename stakes+, with Jordan (+a British model+) +calling her daughter+ Princess  Tiaamii and Jermaine Jackson (Michael Jackson's brother) +lumbering his son with+  ... +wait for it+ ... Jermajesty. But non-celebrity parents +aren't far behind+.

'My pupils have +increasingly outlandish names+: says one secondary school teacher +from north London+. She cites 'poorly spelt names' +such as+ Amba, Jordon, Charlee and Moniqua, and what she calls '+absurd names+' +like+ Shaliqua and Sharday. How will +such names affect her students+ when they +go out to get a job+? 'I think it's a +serious disadvantage+: she says.

Albert Mehrabian +agrees that+ '+deliberately misspelt names+ are +disastrous+'. But Pamela Satran +has a more relaxed take+: 'How these names +are perceived+ is something that's +changing very rapidly+: she says. '+Celebrity culture+ and +ethnic diversity+ have made people +much more eager+ to look for +a wide range of+ names of their own. The +thinking is if+ you have a special name, +that makes you+ a special person.'
