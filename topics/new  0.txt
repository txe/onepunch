Mia was alone, homeless and sad. She'd lost her parents when she was young, run away and was living on the cold, unwelcoming streets. The people who passed her every day were cruel, she always *came under attack* from their comments, they all had the same *preconceptions* about homeless people. They said she was lazy, and should find a job. It was hard to *challenge the stereotypes* people had, when the city offered almost no opportunities to work for someone sleeping rough.

One day, an elderly man stopped and talked to her. He had a kind face, and gave her some food and money. He explained that he had once been homeless, cold and hungry, just like her, but he *took advantage of an opportunity * someone had given him. Now he was living a comfortable life and had his own house. His words *have a profound effect on* her, and she just wanted to know more.
He promised to show her his secret, but said she would need to listen carefully - she would be *on a steep learning curve*. They went back to his house, and he poured hot soup into a bowl for her. They talked about many things, then he described his experience to her. He described how he had worked selling newspapers on the street, but because of a secret he had been told, he *learned the ropes* quickly, and soon moved up to run his own newspaper. He then revealed the secret to her.
She listened while he explained the secret. At first it was so simple, she couldn't believe it and *have second thoughts* - maybe this old man was mad and she should leave.
But the old man insisted she keep *an open mind*, and so she went on listening. He made such *a convincing argument* that eventually she began to believe him.

She went back to the streets, but this time with hope burning in her heart. Her idea was to create jewellery and ornaments from the things she found on the street. She collected normal, everyday things which most people threw away, and turned them into objects of beauty. Soon, she began selling these in the local market. She remembered the man's secret and *never give up*.
Mia enjoyed the work, even though she didn't make much money. Eventually, she had enough to rent a small apartment and began to see life *from a new perspective*. One day, a woman who worked for a well-known design company visited the market, and noticed Mia's designs. She fell in love with Mia's unique style, and offered her a top design job. Mia proved to be an instant success, and the woman was glad she'd *trusted her instincts* by hiring Mia.

And so Mia became successful, and lived the life she'd always wanted. One day, she was walking along the dark, cold streets, when she saw a young, homeless man, looking lonely and tired. She sat down and said; 'Let me tell you a secret.' What was that secret? Always *believe in yourself*.
