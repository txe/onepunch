Pete got on very well with his neighbour Lucy. In fact, they were also pleased to help one another out whenever possible.

One day when Lucy was going on vocation to her parents, Pete agreed to take care of her house. The day after Lucy left, Peter was horrified to see that his dog was dragging a rabbit from Lucy's garden in its mouth. Needless to say, this rabbit was Lucy's pet and very dead one.

Pete's vivid imagination immediately suggested that Lucy would never forgive him. The very first thought was to put the corpse back in the cage like the rabbit had just stopped living for natural causes, and probably Lucy would find it convincing. But he had second thoughts because it also would have meant he hadn't managed his responsibility. By the end of the day he had seen the situation from a whole new perspective, all he needed was a live rabbit which was similar to old. So, he found it, put the rabbit in the cage and kept his dog away from it for the rest of the week.

Pete was feeding his dog when the phone rang. It was Lucy returned from the parents and asking him what the rabbit was in the cage. But wasn't it yours, answered Pete trying to be surprised. No, mine had been with me.
