Am I allowed to drive with the +driving license+ issued in my home country?
You should apply for an international driving +permit+ and carry both the permit and your origianl drivers license on you.
If you +exceed+ the maximum +speed limit+ on +highways+, you can get +a fine+ or even be sent to prison depending on your speed.
If you see this road sign, you should stop before your car enters (перекресток)+the intersection+
Let other cars and (пешеходы)+pedestrans+ pass if they are in your path
+Yield+ means let other road users go first.
A +solid+ yellow line means that passing is prohibited.
Sign indicates that +vehicles+ may not stop at this location at any time. You may not +drop off+ or +pick up+ passengers.
Can you park next to +a fire hydrant+?
When are you allow not to pay for the +parking+ at +muni-meters+?
You mentioned Portland luckily has cycle-+lanes+ and citizens who observe safe-biking practice.
There is such a thing as an unmarked +crosswalk+ at nearly every intersection.
